Getting Things Done (GTD) is a personal productivity system developed by David Allen and published in a book of the same name.[1] GTD is described as a time management system.[2] Allen states "there is an inverse relationship between things on your mind and those things getting done".[3][a]

## Perspective

Allen recommends reflection from six levels, called "Horizons of Focus":[1]: 215–219  

* Horizon 5: Life
* Horizon 4: Long-term visions
* Horizon 3: 1–2 year goals
* Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountability
* Horizon 1: Current projects
* Ground: Current actions
