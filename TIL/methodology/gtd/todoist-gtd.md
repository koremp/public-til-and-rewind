# Todoist GTD

<https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done>

1. **Capture Everything**: Capture anything that crosses your mind. Nothing is too big or small! These items go directly into your inboxes.
2. **Clarify**: Process what you’ve captured into clear and concrete action steps. Decide if an item is a project, next action, or reference.
3. **Organize**: Put everything into the right place. Add dates to your calendar, delegate projects to other people, file away reference material, and sort your tasks.
4. **Review**: Frequently look over, update, and revise your lists.
5. **Engage**: Get to work on the important stuff.

>Some very specific but seemingly mundane behaviors, when applied, produce the capacity to exist in a kind of sophisticated spontaneity, which, in my experience, is a key element to a successful life.
